       <p>We understand that sometimes choosing an<br>
           anime to watch can be a difficult process,<br>
           exacerbated by wierd titles, foreign words and<br>
           a sense of “I don’t know what I’m in the mood for”.
           <br><br><br><br><br>
           Anime Dashboard stats can help you choose something<br>
           totally awsome to watch without having to ponder over<br>
           lengthy synopsises,confusing titles or even think too<br>
           much about what it is you are *truly* in the mood for.
           <br><br><br><br><br>
           ANIME DASHBOARD focuses on three important pieces<br>
           of data to help you out here. The first is popularity<br>
           (the number of people who have joined the group related<br>
           to the anime), the second is average user rating<br>
           (the average score out of 10 each user has rated the anime),<br>
           and the third is genre.
           <br><br><br><br><br>
           Anime dashboard got its data from<br>
           https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database<br>
           Which got it’s data from MyAnimeList.net
           <br><br><br><br><br>
           Definitions of genre and terminology were taken from<br>
           google and wikepidia.
